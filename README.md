# Freekick_Bot_FIFA18


This project is a simple setup which simulates FIFA 18 freekicks.

It tries to train itself by performing various actions (shooting high, shooting low, moving the player left and moving the player on the right)

It also simulates restarting the drill after the drill is over for continuous interrupted training.
